Recommendation Service
   ↓
AI Provider / Models
```

AI output must be validated before being stored or used.

### Frontend

AI should appear as assistance, not unexplained automation.

Users should be able to:

- review
- edit
- accept
- reject

AI-generated plans.

### Requirements

Do not allow an LLM to directly modify critical user data without explicit confirmation.

### Exit Criteria

AI features improve measurable user outcomes or engagement instead of existing only as a marketing feature.

---

# Phase 14 — Advanced Analytics and Scale

### Goal

Introduce specialized infrastructure only when real scale requires it.

Possible changes:

- ClickHouse for event/product analytics
- read replicas
- dedicated workers
- CDN for exercise media
- more aggressive caching
- search engine
- service extraction

### Backend Requirements

Before introducing a new system, identify a measurable bottleneck.

Examples:

```text
PostgreSQL analytics query too slow
→ evaluate ClickHouse

Exercise search limitations
→ evaluate OpenSearch

API module independently scaling
→ consider service extraction
```

Do not introduce infrastructure only because it may be useful later.

### Architecture Principle

Scale based on measurements.

Do not automatically move from:

```text
modular monolith
```

to:

```text
microservices
```

because the user count increases.

Extract services only where operational or organizational boundaries justify it.

---

# MVP Definition

The MVP is complete when a Persian-speaking user can:

1. Register using a phone number.
2. Create a profile.
3. Browse exercises.
4. Create a workout routine.
5. Start a workout.
6. Track sets, reps, and weight.
7. Finish the workout even with unreliable connectivity.
8. View workout history.
9. View basic performance analytics.
10. Track body weight and measurements.
11. Log basic nutrition.
